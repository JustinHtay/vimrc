# vimrc
Very simple vimrc. 
Standard syntax enable, indent, searching, cursor, number options.
Mapped gj -> j, gk -> k for ease of movement.
Mapped shift+b and shift+e to go to beginning and end of line, since b and e go to beginning of word already.
Smarttab and expandtab, tab size 3.
Using inkpot colorscheme.
